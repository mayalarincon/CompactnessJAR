This project contains the Isabell/HOL formalization of the compactness theorem for propositional logic 
using the model existence theorem approach.
In addition, it contains three applications:
1. formalizations of Hall's theorem for the set and the graph theoretical case for countable sets and graphs;
2. a formalization of de Bruijn-Erdös k-coloring theorem for countable graphs;
3. and, a formalization of König's Lemma.
