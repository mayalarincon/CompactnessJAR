This project contains the Isabell/HOL formalization of the compactness theorem for propositional logic 
using Smullyan's model existence theorem approach according to Fitting presentation.
In addition, it contains three applications:
1. formalizations of Hall's theorem for the set- and the graph-theoretical case for countable sets
   and graphs;
2. a formalization of de Bruijn-Erdös k-coloring theorem for countable graphs;
4. and, a formalization of König's Lemma.

Except for the graph-theoretical version of Hall's theorem, obtained from the set-theoretical version
of Hall's theorem, the applications are proved constructively building sets of propositional formulas 
and models, and applying the compactness theorem.
